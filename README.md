PHYSICAL DESIGN IN VLSI
Physical design in VLSI is the process of converting a circuit's high-level description into a detailed physical layout on silicon. It involves steps like partitioning, floorplanning, placement, routing, and verification to optimize performance, area, power, and manufacturability. The goal is to create a layout that can be fabricated into a functional chip.
