# Digital-VLSI-SoC-Design-and-planning

Welcome to the OpenLane workshop! In this workshop, we will delve into the process of designing an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) to the Graphical Data System (GDS) file using the OpenLane ASIC flow. The flow is composed of several key steps, starting with an RTL file and culminating in a GDS file.

# PHYSICAL DESIGN IN VLSI

# Day 1 - Inception of open-source EDA OpenLANE and sky130 PDK

# KY L1 Introduction to QFN-48 Package chip pads core die and IPs
# Arduino Board
This is an arduino microcontroller board. The encircled area shows the chip(microprocessor) which is interfaced with other components of the board. The designing of this chip from abstract level all the way down to the fabrication is done by RTL to GDSll flow.Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on the computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

# Microcontroller Board Components
# Core:
Definition: The central processing unit (CPU) of the microcontroller that executes instructions. Example: ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V core. 
# Die:
Definition: The physical silicon chip on which the microcontrollerâ€™s circuitry is fabricated.
# Pad:
Definition: The physical connection points on the microcontroller chip where external components are connected.

# GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output):
Definition: Pins on the microcontroller that can be programmed to either input signals (e.g., sensors) or output signals (e.g., LEDs).

# Bank:
Definition: A grouping of I/O pins or memory segments used for organization within the microcontroller. For GPIO, it refers to a set of pins grouped together.

# Foundries:
Definition: Facilities where the microcontroller chips are manufactured. Examples include TSMC, Intel.

# IPs (Intellectual Properties):
Definition: Pre-designed blocks of logic that can be integrated into the microcontroller. Examples include UART, SPI, and I2C controllers.

# SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory):
Definition: A type of volatile memory used for temporary data storage within the microcontroller. Fast but more expensive and power-consuming than DRAM.

# DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory):
Definition: A type of volatile memory used for larger, temporary data storage. Requires periodic refreshing to maintain data.

# ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter):
Definition: Converts analog signals (e.g., sensor outputs) into digital values that can be processed by the microcontroller.

# DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):
Definition: Converts digital values into analog signals (e.g., to drive speakers or analog displays).

# RISC-V SoC (System on Chip):
Definition: A microcontroller or microprocessor incorporating a RISC-V core along with additional integrated components such as memory, peripherals, and communication interfaces.

# Macros:
Definition: Predefined sequences of code or hardware configurations used to simplify and automate repetitive tasks in programming or hardware design.

# Connecting All Components
Core: Executes instructions and processes data. Die: Houses the core and other integrated components. Pad: Connects the die to external components via GPIO. GPIO: Interfaces with external devices, configured via macros. Bank: Organizes GPIO and other resources. Foundries: Manufacture the microcontroller with the integrated core, SRAM, DRAM, ADC, DAC, and IPs. IPs: Provide specialized functions like UART and SPI, integrated into the SoC. SRAM & DRAM: Store data temporarily for processing and operation. ADC & DAC: Enable analog signal processing and generation. This layout ensures a microcontroller can interact with the external world and perform complex tasks by integrating various components into a single, functional chip.

# SKY L1 Introduction to all components of an open-source digital ASIC design
#RTL Design (Register Transfer Level Design):
Definition: Describes the logic and behavior of a digital circuit using registers and the data transfers between them. Purpose: Defines the functionality and operations of the circuit.

#EDA Tools (Electronic Design Automation Tools):
Definition: Software tools used for designing, simulating, and verifying electronic systems and integrated circuits.

#Open-Source Tools:
QROad: Focuses on routing within digital ASIC designs. OpenROAD: Provides a comprehensive tool suite for placement, routing, and design rule checking. OpenLane: Offers an end-to-end RTL-to-GDSII flow, integrating with other open-source tools.

#PDK (Process Design Kit):
Definition: Contains files and information from semiconductor foundries describing the manufacturing process and design rules. Purpose: Ensures designs are manufacturable and provides parameters for accurate simulation.

#Google Skywater 130nm PDK:
Definition: An open-source PDK for the SkyWater 130nm process technology. Features: Includes libraries, design rules, and models specific to the 130nm technology node.
